### About

I love Linux and everything related to it. I prefer the command line to graphical applications.
Also, I am interested in mathematical statistics and machine learning.
In my free time, if possible, I go in for sports tourism, in particular, mountain tourism. In 2019,
I climbed Kazbek (5033 m, 2B category) and in 2021, Elbrus (5642 m, 2A category).
